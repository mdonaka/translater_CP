By combining all component estimates H
i
ed through (3), the estimate for the probabilistic objective
^ ð xj f θ g Þ is obtained, and the multi-objective design
vector H
under uncertainty problem can be then solved by substituting
H (x) with that estimate. The resultant optimization problem is
computationally challenging to solve, primarily due to the
high computational cost associated with each performance
function vector evaluation and the existence of an unavoidable
stochastic simulation estimation error. To address these chal-
lenges, a metamodeling-aided approach in augmented input
space is formulated in this paper.
